      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        A game of Card Game Name represents a battle between two powerful witches. They draw on the power of five magical elements to summon creatures and cast spells.<br>
        This game is intended to be played with nothing more than a deck of 30 cards per player. 
      </p>

      <h1>Decks</h1>
      <p>
        Each player begins the game with a deck of exactly 30 cards. They can be any combination of elements or types, as long as they follow the following rules:
        <ul>
          <li>Decks cannot contain more than 2 copies of a card with the same name.</li>
          <li>Decks cannot contain any more than 1 "Hero" type card, regardless of the cards' names.</li>
        </ul>
        The cards remaining in a player's deck represent the magical power they have left. Once a player runs out of cards, they lose the game!
      </p>

      <h2>Name</h2>
      <p>
        The name of a card. No more than 2 cards with the same name are allowed in a deck.
      </p>
      <h2>Type</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creature cards summon creatures to fight for you.</li>
          <li>Spell cards can have instant effects (e.g. a quick Firebolt destroying an enemy creature), or exist permanently as spells (providing an ongoing effect) or enchantments (giving creatures extra effects).</li>
          <li>Items can exist permanently on the battlefield or be equipped to creatures providing effects similar to spells.</li>
          <li>Hero cards represent powerful allies that provide ongoing benefits unless destroyed by your opponent.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Cost</h2>
      <p>
        The cost of a card is the amount of mana you must channel in order to play it. The five element symbols (Fire, Earth, Air, Water, and Spirit) represent one mana each of their element, and the Real symbol (the second symbol of the cost of this card) represents one mana of any element except Spirit.
      </p>
      <h2>Element</h2>
      <p>
        When channeled, a card provides one mana of its element. Some card effects also reference the elements of other cards.
      </p>
      <h2>Card Text</h2>
      <p>
        A card's text describes a special effect it has. Instructions are performed when a card is played, and ongoing effects continue as long as the card is on the battlefield.
      </p>
      <h2>Stats</h2>
      <p>
        Creatures have stats that represent their fighting ability. They are written as [Attack] / [Health]. Attack is the amount of damage a creature will deal to its target or attacker in combat. Health is the amount of damage a creature must take in a turn to be destroyed.
      </p>

      <h1>Gameplay</h1>
      <h2>Start of Game</h2>
      <p>
        Randomly determine a player to start. Both players draw 4 cards from their decks. Both players choose any number of cards from their opening hand to replace. They set those aside and draw back up to 4 cards, then shuffle the set aside cards into their decks.
      </p>
      <h2>Turn Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Play alternates between players. Each turn is composed of phases that cannot be skipped or re-ordered.
      </p>
      <h3>Start of Turn</h3>
      <p>Your start of turn effects occur. If more than one occur, your effects occur before your opponent's. You may determine the order of your effects.</p>
      <p>After all start of turn effects, draw a card.</p>
      <h3>Main Phase I</h3>
      <p>
        Play any cards from your hand. The only cards that can be played outside of your Main phases are Reaction spells.
      </p>
      <h3>Battle</h3>
      <p>Only creatures that have been under their owner's control since the start of this turn may participate in battle (attacking or counterattacking).</p>
      <p>
        Select a creature you control, and a target for it to attack (enemy creatures, or the enemy Player if they control no creatures that can can be targeted with attacks). The attacker deals its attack in damage to the target, and then the target deals its attack in damage to the attacker. If either is reduced to 0 HP they are destroyed. Repeat for as many of your creatures as you wish. Once you are done attacking, you cannot make any more attacks. Your opponent can make counterattacks. This functions exactly the same as attacking.
      </p>
      <h3>Main Phase II</h3>
      <p>The same as Main phase I.</p>
      <h3>End of Turn</h3>
      <p>Your end of turn effects occur. Ordering is decided the same as for "start of turn" effects.</p>
      <p>If you are holding more than 7 cards, exile cards from your hand one at a time until you have 7 or less cards in hand.</p>
      <p>Finally, all living creatures return to full health.</p>

      <h1>Winning and Losing</h1>
      <p>When a player is dealt damage, they must exile cards from the top of their deck equal to the damage taken. If a player must draw, burn, or exile a card from their deck, but cannot because it is empty, they lose the game.</p>
      <p>Either player may at any time concede the game.</p>
      <p>If both players lose the game at the same time, the game is a draw.</p>
      
      <h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
      <p>Burn a card: Add the top card of your deck to your mana pool.</p>
      <p>Counter: Exile a spell. Its effect does not occur. The player that played it still pays its cost.</p>
